Thanks! You've clearly defined your **user story** and dataset, which allows us to create a powerful SQL-based reporting layer for **bot performance analysis and improvement**.

## ‚úÖ User Story (Expanded)

> **As a data analyst**, I want to **run SQL queries, cursors, functions, and stored procedures** on **historical bot interaction data**, so that I can extract **meaningful insights and generate custom reports** for business analysis.

---

## üì¶ Dataset Table: `bot_interactions`

We‚Äôll assume your table is structured like this:

```sql
CREATE TABLE bot_interactions (
    interaction_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    timestamp DATETIME,
    user_query TEXT,
    intent_detected VARCHAR(100),
    bot_response TEXT,
    response_time_ms INT,
    prediction_accuracy FLOAT,
    entity_extraction_accuracy FLOAT,
    user_sentiment VARCHAR(20),
    user_feedback VARCHAR(30),
    conversation_success VARCHAR,
    user_id VARCHAR,
    user_type VARCHAR(20),
    region VARCHAR(50),
    device_type VARCHAR(30),
    account_age_months INT,
    is_premium BOOLEAN
);
```

---

## üîç 1. Sample SQL Queries (For Custom Reports)

### üìä A. Top 5 Slowest Intents (Average Response Time)

```sql
SELECT 
    intent_detected,
    ROUND(AVG(response_time_ms), 2) AS avg_response_time
FROM bot_interactions
GROUP BY intent_detected
ORDER BY avg_response_time DESC
LIMIT 5;
```

---

### üòä B. Feedback Score by Region and User Type

```sql
SELECT 
    region,
    user_type,
    user_feedback,
    COUNT(*) AS total_feedbacks
FROM bot_interactions
GROUP BY region, user_type, user_feedback
ORDER BY total_feedbacks DESC;
```

---

### üéØ C. Intent Accuracy Over Time (Monthly Trend)

```sql
SELECT 
    DATE_FORMAT(timestamp, '%Y-%m') AS month,
    intent_detected,
    ROUND(AVG(prediction_accuracy), 2) AS avg_prediction_accuracy
FROM bot_interactions
GROUP BY month, intent_detected
ORDER BY month;
```

---

### üìâ D. Failed Conversations (Conversation Success = FALSE)

```sql
SELECT 
    intent_detected,
    COUNT(*) AS failed_conversations
FROM bot_interactions
WHERE conversation_success = FALSE
GROUP BY intent_detected
ORDER BY failed_conversations DESC;
```

---

## üîÑ 2. Cursor + Stored Procedure: Analyze Feedback Per Intent

### üí° Task:

* For each `intent_detected`, calculate:

  * Total interactions
  * Helpful feedback count
  * Needs improvement count

```sql
DELIMITER $$

CREATE PROCEDURE AnalyzeFeedbackPerIntent()
BEGIN
    DECLARE done INT DEFAULT FALSE;
    DECLARE intent_name VARCHAR(100);

    DECLARE intent_cursor CURSOR FOR 
        SELECT DISTINCT intent_detected FROM bot_interactions;

    DECLARE CONTINUE HANDLER FOR NOT FOUND SET done = TRUE;

    CREATE TEMPORARY TABLE IF NOT EXISTS intent_feedback_summary (
        intent VARCHAR(100),
        total INT,
        helpful INT,
        needs_improvement INT
    );

    OPEN intent_cursor;

    read_loop: LOOP
        FETCH intent_cursor INTO intent_name;
        IF done THEN
            LEAVE read_loop;
        END IF;

        INSERT INTO intent_feedback_summary
        SELECT
            intent_name,
            COUNT(*) AS total,
            SUM(CASE WHEN user_feedback = 'Helpful' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS helpful,
            SUM(CASE WHEN user_feedback = 'Needs Improvement' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS needs_improvement
        FROM bot_interactions
        WHERE intent_detected = intent_name;

    END LOOP;

    CLOSE intent_cursor;

    SELECT * FROM intent_feedback_summary;
END$$

DELIMITER ;
```

üìå You can run it using:

```sql
CALL AnalyzeFeedbackPerIntent();
```

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è 3. Function: Response Quality Score (0‚Äì1 scale)

```sql
DELIMITER $$

CREATE FUNCTION GetResponseQualityScore(
    acc FLOAT, 
    entity_acc FLOAT, 
    response_time INT
) RETURNS FLOAT
DETERMINISTIC
BEGIN
    DECLARE score FLOAT;
    SET score = ((acc + entity_acc) / 2) * (1 - (response_time / 2000.0));
    RETURN GREATEST(0, LEAST(1, score));
END$$

DELIMITER ;
```

üìå Usage Example:

```sql
SELECT 
    interaction_id,
    GetResponseQualityScore(prediction_accuracy, entity_extraction_accuracy, response_time_ms) AS quality_score
FROM bot_interactions
ORDER BY quality_score DESC
LIMIT 10;
```

---

## üìã 4. Report Stored Procedure: Premium Users Only

```sql
DELIMITER $$

CREATE PROCEDURE PremiumUserReport()
BEGIN
    SELECT 
        user_id,
        user_type,
        intent_detected,
        COUNT(*) AS total_interactions,
        AVG(response_time_ms) AS avg_response_time,
        SUM(CASE WHEN conversation_success THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS success_count
    FROM bot_interactions
    WHERE is_premium = TRUE
    GROUP BY user_id, intent_detected;
END$$

DELIMITER ;
```

---

## üìà Useful Views for BI Tools (e.g. Power BI)

```sql
CREATE VIEW intent_summary AS
SELECT 
    intent_detected,
    COUNT(*) AS total_interactions,
    AVG(response_time_ms) AS avg_response_time,
    AVG(prediction_accuracy) AS avg_accuracy,
    SUM(CASE WHEN user_feedback = 'Helpful' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS helpful_count,
    SUM(CASE WHEN user_feedback = 'Needs Improvement' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS improvement_count
FROM bot_interactions
GROUP BY intent_detected;
```

You can now directly connect Power BI to this view for visualizations.

## üìå Next Steps

These queries will help you answer:

* Who are your power users?
* Which intents need retraining?
* Where is performance falling short (by region/device)?
* Are premium users more satisfied?
* How does sentiment align with feedback?

If you'd like, I can also create:

* **Materialized views** for dashboards
* **Export-ready CSV queries**
* **Triggers to track improvements over time**

Let me know if you want these queries bundled or visualized directly in **Power BI** or a Jupyter Notebook for easy reporting.
