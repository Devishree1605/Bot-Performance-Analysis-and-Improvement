To generate Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) using Power BI based on your dataset and the goals in User Story 3, here’s a complete plan with practical implementation steps:
________________________________________
✅ Key Performance Indicators in Power BI
Based on your dataset and defined metrics:
•	Response Time (ms)
•	Success Rate
•	User Drop-off Points
•	(Optional) Accuracy & Sentiment Trends
________________________________________
🛠️ Step-by-Step Guide
🔹 1. Prepare the Dataset
Make sure your dataset includes the following fields (as per your generated CSV):
Column Name	Description
Interaction ID	Unique ID for each interaction
Timestamp	Date and time of interaction
User Query	Text query from user
Intent Detected	Predicted intent
Bot Response	Response from the bot
Response Time (ms)	Time taken to respond
Prediction Accuracy (%)	Model prediction confidence
Entity Extraction Accuracy (%)	Entity detection accuracy
User Sentiment	Positive / Neutral / Negative
User Feedback	Helpful / Needs improvement
Conversation Success	Successful / Failed
________________________________________
🔹 2. Load Data into Power BI
1.	Open Power BI Desktop.
2.	Click Home > Get Data > CSV and load your file trading_bot_dataset.csv.
3.	Review the data in Data view.
________________________________________
🔹 3. Create Measures for KPIs
✅ Success Rate (%)
Success Rate (%) = 
VAR Total = COUNT('Table'[Interaction ID])
VAR Success = CALCULATE(COUNT('Table'[Conversation Success]), 'Table'[Conversation Success] = "Successful")
RETURN DIVIDE(Success, Total) * 100
✅ Average Response Time (ms)
Avg Response Time (ms) = AVERAGE('Table'[Response Time (ms)])
✅ Drop-Off Rate (%)
Assuming drop-off is indicated by “Failed” conversations:
Drop-Off Rate (%) = 
VAR Total = COUNT('Table'[Interaction ID])
VAR Failed = CALCULATE(COUNT('Table'[Conversation Success]), 'Table'[Conversation Success] = "Failed")
RETURN DIVIDE(Failed, Total) * 100
✅ Average Accuracy Score
Avg Prediction Accuracy (%) = AVERAGE('Table'[Prediction Accuracy (%)])
✅ Sentiment Distribution (Pie or Bar)
No DAX needed—just use User Sentiment in a pie chart or bar chart.

🔹 4. Create KPI Visuals
Use Power BI KPI or Card Visuals:
•	Add a Card for:
o	Success Rate
o	Drop-Off Rate
o	Avg Response Time
o	Avg Accuracy
Use Bar Charts or Pie Charts for:
•	User Sentiment
•	Intent Distribution
•	Feedback Summary
Use Line Graph for:
•	Response Time over time (Timestamp on X-axis)
________________________________________
🔹 5. Enhance the Report with Filters
•	Add slicers for:
o	Time range (from Timestamp)
o	Sentiment
o	Intent
o	Channel (if applicable later)
________________________________________
🧪 Optional Benchmarks (Could Have)
If you define thresholds (e.g., ideal Success Rate > 85%), you can use conditional formatting:
•	Green for above threshold
•	Red for below threshold
Example in KPI visual options > Indicators.

📊 Sample Layout for Dashboard
Visual	Metric
KPI Card	Success Rate (%)
KPI Card	Avg Response Time (ms)
KPI Card	Drop-Off Rate (%)
Pie Chart	User Sentiment Distribution
Bar Chart	Intent Frequency
Line Chart	Response Time Over Time
Table	Interaction Log with key fields
________________________________________
🧾 Notes:
•	Replace 'Table' with your actual table name in Power BI.
•	You can create custom tooltips to show supporting metrics when hovering over visuals.
•	If you’re using Power BI Service, you can schedule data refreshes.
